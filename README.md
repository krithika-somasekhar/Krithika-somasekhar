## 📌 About Me

I'm a data enthusiast and strategic thinker with over **3 years of experience** using data to influence business outcomes across telecom, healthcare, and education sectors. I specialize in **SQL, Python, and cloud-native tools** to extract insights and build automated, scalable data workflows.

I don't just crunch numbers — I **tell stories with data** and align them with business goals through project management frameworks. My strength lies in understanding both the technical and human side of data: how to structure it, visualize it, and make it resonate with decision-makers.
